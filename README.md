This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the SQL homework. Overall, this was a
very straightforward homework.

All of the required files can be found within the 'EmployeeSQL' folder, as
required in the instructions.

The 'Entity Relationship Diagram' contains a PDF with the ERD inside of it. I
used Visio instead of Quick DBD as recommended during class because I felt more
familiar with making ERDs in Visio, since I took a course for basic SQL a while
back, which used Visio for ERDs.

The 'Query + Table Creation Files' contains the code for the creation of
the tables (create_tables.sql), viewing the tables (view_tables.sql), and the
queries as required by the assignment (data_analysis_queries.sql). Should the
.sql files not work, I have included .txt file backups. 

Finally, the 'Resources' folder simply contains the original .csv files used
for the assignment.
